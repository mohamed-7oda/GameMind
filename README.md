# ⚽ AI-Based Football Event Detection System

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to build an **AI-based system** that can automatically detect football events such as **goals, fouls, and substitutions** from match videos.
The goal is to improve sports analysis and provide quick insights for coaches, analysts, and broadcasters.

---

## 🧠 Current Phase

We are currently in the **Preprocessing Phase**, which includes:

* Collecting and organizing data from the **SoccerNet** dataset.
* Extracting video frames and event segments.
* Preparing data for model training (resizing, labeling, normalization).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect and classify football match events using deep learning.
* Achieve high accuracy and speed in event detection.
* Ensure the system works well across different match videos.
